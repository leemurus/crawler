# Crawler

After you click the "go" button, the app crawls all the URLs in the given webpage and displays to the customer 
a complete list of all the URLs the crawler found, including nested links. So essentially what you need to do is 
implement a simple web crawler in the form of a Django web app.

Take home part should not be a “production ready” solution, however we encourage you to write a clean and readable 
code like you would do in real life.
